# User Experience Research and Design Specialization

Hi! My name is Alexis Raymond and I am a Management Information Systems and Analytics student at the Telfer School of Management of the University of Ottawa.

I have always been intrigued by how some products like websites, apps and video games are astonishing visually and easy to use for all age groups and I wish to one day be able to create products of the kind.

That is why I want to pursue a career in product management and User Experience design. However, to be successful in such a role, I must develop skills outside the classroom and practice constantly.

For this reason, I decided to pursue the [User Experience Research and Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/michiganux) from the University of Michigan on Coursera.

This specialization is composed of the following courses:
1. Introduction to User Experience Principles and Processes
2. Understanding User Needs
3. Evaluating Designs with Users
4. UX Design: From Concept to Prototype
5. UX Research at Scale: Surveys, Analytics Online Testing
6. UX(User Experience) Capstone

Out of this specialization I seek to improve my ability to **create and evaluate products that make it easy and satisfying for a user to achieve their goals**!

I will be storing my notes and assignments in this repository as a reference for myself and to inspire others to pursue this journey.
